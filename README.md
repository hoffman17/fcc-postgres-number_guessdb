This was my final project of five for my relational databases certification. Here I created a number_guess database in PostgreSQL that tracks new or returning users progress in a number guessing game. I used a bash script to query the database and insert values based on user prompts for the game in the shell script. Additionally, I used Git to stage changes and commit them as I progressed through the project.
